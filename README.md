This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### About this project
A music player application that allows users to play music from playlists once signed-in.
With NextJS you can call server-side functions to fetch your data from within  your front-end 
application, and/or create API endpoints. Next.js lets you choose which pre-rendering form you'd 
like to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for 
most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others. You can also use Client-side Rendering 
along with Static Generation or Server-side Rendering. That means some parts of a page can be 
rendered entirely by client side JavaScript too.
