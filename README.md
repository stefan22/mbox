### About this project
A music player application that allows users to play music from playlists once signed-in.
Why? 
Because I wanted 
to build something with NextJS      
NextJS is a JS framework built on top of React that can handle both front-end and backend 
development. For example, retrieving data server side from within your pages directory in your 
front-end application (with getServerSideProps) and features like Automatic Static 
Optimisation that  will hydrate the application for you.

- Type `npm install` in the terminal to dependencies.    
- Type `npm run dev` in the terminal to start the development server.
