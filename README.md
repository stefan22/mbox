### About this project
Another music player application that allows users to play music from playlists once signed-in.    
Why? wanted to build a project with NextJS - a framework built on top of React. With NextJS you can call server-side functions to 
fetch your data from within your front-end application. NextJS automatically configures some of your pages (Automatic Static Optimization), it lets you choose which pre-rendering to use for each page and create hybrid applications. Another nice feature is Middleware for edge functions/CDN.
